<h1>MAVIS TALKING ABOUT HER ADVENTURES IN COCKTAILS</h1>
<div>
    <p>I've been trying to teach myself how to make cocktails and this
        is modeled after a website with some really interesting articles and recipies.
        I'm starting by learning about sours because I like them and it was the first 
        thing I thought of.

    <h3>MY HUMBLE BEGININGS</h3>
    <p>I started my journy by making and amaretto sour because I've had one before
        and a lot of people I know like them. I also realized that all I would need
        to pick up from the liquor store was amaretto and burbon and everything else
        I couls get from the grocery. To my surprise shaking something with an egg
        in it was actually pretty hard because the egg expands so much that it makes
        it hard to keep the shaker closed and then I'd end up having it pop open 
        while I was shaking the drink and make a mess.

    <h3>MY AMARETTO SOUR</h3>
    <p>-1 1/2 oz Amaretto</p>
    <p>-3/4ish oz Burbon</p>
    <p>-1ish oz lemon or lime juice (depends what I've got)</p>
    <p>-2 little spoons of cherry surup</p>
    <p>-1 egg white</p>
    <p>Put everything in a shaker with no ice and shake it vigorously. 
        The eggwnite will expand and you'll probably end up making a 
        mess but it doesn't foam right otherwise. Then shake it all up
        with ice and serve. Garnish with citiris rind and merechino 
        cherries.
